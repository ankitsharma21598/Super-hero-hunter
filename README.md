Project Link: https://ankitsharma21598.github.io/Super-hero-hunter/

This is a superHero Hunter App
1. We are using vanilla JS plus basic HTML and CSS for development
2. Three pages are present 

    a. Index (which is the Homapage)
  
    b. charDetails (which is the individual superhero page)
  
    c. likedHeros (which is the Liked Heros page)
  
3. User can search for the SuperHeros.
4. User can add the searched heros into liked heros list.
5. User can see the liked heros in a liked heros page and can remove the heros from there.
6. I have used the localStorage of browser so that the list is presistant.
